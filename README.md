# Football-Penalty-Game
In my riveting journey through CSE423 - Computer Graphics, I found myself crafting an enticingly interactive football penalty game using the intriguing tool of OpenGL Python. This project became a canvas on which I painted with algorithms like the meticulous Midpoint Line, the symmetric Midpoint Circle, and the efficient Zoning - keystones of computer graphics.

A challenging but rewarding aspect of this endeavor was the creation of dynamic human characters, and the ball. These digital things, brought to life by the power of algorithms, could be transformed at my whim. They danced to my tune, scaling, rotating, and altering their form under my command.

The finale of this digital symphony was a game mechanic that stirred emotions. As the tension of the game built, it was designed to climax when a player scored three goals. This event would trigger the emergence of screens declaring victory or defeat, adding a dramatic twist to the experience.

This project was a testament to the spellbinding world of computer graphics, and an ode to the blend of creativity and technical skill it requires. It was a challenge that left me richer in experience and knowledge, stoking my passion for this vibrant field.
